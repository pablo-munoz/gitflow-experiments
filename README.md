# Gitflow

The purpose of this repo is so that I learn to use git flow.

# Feature Branches

Feature branches are branches where you do development. This branches
are eventually merged into `develop`. The goal is to accumulate a
number of features (although it could be only one) into a
"development" block to be considered as a candidate for release.
